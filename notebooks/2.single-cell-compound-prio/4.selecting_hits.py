# ## Identifying hits
#
# In this section, we analyze the generated scores from the previous step. These scores quantify the magnitudes of phenotypic differences between the "on" and "off" morphological signatures. The "on" morphological signatures represent the morphology features that are significantly affected when compared to a reference state. In contrast, the "off" morphological signatures are features that remain unaffected by both states, making them a reliable source for tracking off-target effects.

# ## Finding potential hits
#
# Here, we load the scores to identify compounds that demonstrate potential reversal effects. Using the loaded scores, we rank the compounds based first on their on-morphology scores and then on their off-morphology scores. These scores were generated using the positive control (healthy CF cells + DMSO), where smaller scores indicate a stronger potential for reversal. Specifically, lower on-morphology scores suggest that the treated cells closely resemble the positive control, while lower off-morphology scores indicate minimal off-target effects.
