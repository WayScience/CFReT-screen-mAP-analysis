#
# In this notebook we are analyzing the mAP scores generated from the previous step shown [here](./1.run-map.ipynb). In this notebook, we are investigating the mAP scores generated to see if we can identify specific compounds that show evidence of reversing cardiac fibrosis.

Next, we calculate the delta mAP, which is the difference between the mAP score generated using the negative control (failing CF cells + DMSO) as the reference and the mAP score generated using the positive control (healthy CF cells + DMSO) as the reference.

# ## Dual-Control mAP Analysis: Evaluating Therapeutic Potential Through Comparative Phenotypic Scoring

# In this section, we use a scatter plot to visualize the distribution of mAP scores, providing insights into the relationships between scores generated from negative and positive controls. This visualization allows us to explore how treatments affect the Failing CF against these two references, helping identify potential compound candidates that reverse the effect of Cardiac Fibrosis.
# - X-Axis: mAP scores calculated by comparing wells containing failing CF cells treated with a compound against the negative control (Failing CF cells + DMSO).
# - Y-Axis: mAP scores calculated by comparing wells containing failing CF cells treated with a compound against the positive control (Healthy CF cells + DMSO).
#
# The generated scatter plot provides an understanding on how treatments impact cell morphology relative to both control conditions.

# The scatter plot provides insights into how treatments affect failing CF cells compared to both control conditions. Here’s how to interpret different regions of the plot:
#
# - **High mAP score on the Y-axis, low mAP score on the X-axis**:
# This indicates that the compound’s effect causes failing CF cells to resemble the negative control (Failing CF cells) and does not resemble to the positive control (Healthy CF cells + DMSO).
#
# - **High mAP scores on both the Y-axis and X-axis**:
# This suggests that the compound triggers a distinct cellular state not well-represented by either control. The high mAP scores on both axes indicate that the compound significantly alters the cells in ways that do not align closely with the negative or positive control conditions.
#
# - **Low mAP score on the Y-axis, high mAP score on the X-axis**:
# This demonstrates a potential reversal effect. The compound causes failing CF cells to move away from the negative control (Failing CF cells + DMSO) and closer to resembling the positive control (Healthy CF cells).
#
# - **Low mAP scores on both the X-axis and Y-axis**:
# This could indicate potential quality control issues, such as poor-quality replicates or inconsistencies in how the compound was applied.

# ## Differential mAP scores Histogram analysis (Pathway Level)
#
# The primary goal of using differential mAP scores (delta_MAP) in this high-content screening is to evaluate the therapeutic potential of 550 compounds for reversing cardiac fibrosis. By comparing the morphological profiles of treated diseased cells against two controls failing cardiac cells + DMSO (negative control) and healthy cardiac cells + DMSO (positive control) the differential mAP scores help identify compounds that effectively shift the diseased phenotype toward the healthy state.

# $$
# \begin{equation}
# \Delta \text{mAP} = \text{mAP}_{\text{Negative Control}} - \text{mAP}_{\text{Positive Control}}
# \end{equation}
# $$
#
# $\text{mAP}_{\text{Negative Control}}  ( X )$:
#
# - The mean average precision score when comparing treated diseased cells to the failing control.
# - A **lower** $X$ indicates that the compound’s effect is similar to the diseased phenotype (minimal therapeutic relevance).
# - A **higher**$X$ indicates that the compound’s effect is different to the diseased phenotype (potential therapeutic relevance)
#
# $\text{mAP}_{\text{Positive Control}}  ( Y )$:
#
# - The mean average precision score when comparing treated diseased cells to the healthy control.
# - A **lower** $Y$ indicates that the compound shifts the disease state closer to to the healthy type (potential therapeutic relevance)
# - A **higher** $Y$ indicates that the compound shifts the diseased cells further to the healthy phenotype. (minimal therapeutic relevance)
#
# $ \Delta \text{mAP}  ( X - Y ):$
# - The difference between  $\text{mAP}{\text{Positive Control}}  and  \text{mAP}{\text{Negative Control}}$ .
# - This score provides a measure of how effectively a compound reverses the failing phenotype in a single value.
#
# #### What is the range of the scores?
#
# The range of these scores is [-1, 1]
#
# - **Positive** $\Delta \text{mAP}$ $(0 < \Delta \text{mAP} \leq 1)$:
#   Indicates the compound aligns more with the healthy phenotype than the diseased phenotype.
#
# - **Negative** $\Delta \text{mAP}$ $(-1 \leq \Delta \text{mAP} < 0)$:
#   Indicates the compound aligns more with the diseased phenotype than the healthy phenotype.
#
# - **Zero** $\Delta \text{mAP}$ $(\Delta \text{mAP} = 0)$:
#   Indicates no difference between the compound's effect on healthy and diseased phenotypes.
