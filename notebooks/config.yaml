trt_copairs_ap_configs:
  # This section contains the configurations used for calculating AP
  # (Average Precision)

  # pos_sameby (list[str]): Using metadata to identify profiles that belong to the same
  # group, that is not the control group (e.g if using some sort of sample id, profiles)
  pos_sameby: ["Metadata_treatment"]

  # pos_diffby (list[str]): Metadata columns used to differentiate positive pairs.
  # If specified, positive pairs must differ in these columns. Since replicates are
  # defined at the plate level, this parameter ensures that positive pairs are
  # identified across different plates.
  pos_diffby: ["Metadata_plate_barcode"]

  # neg_diffby (list[str]): Define negative pairs as profiles where one belongs to a group
  # of compound replicates and the other to DMSO controls
  neg_diffby: ["Metadata_treatment"]

  # batch_size (int): The batch size for processing similarity computations
  # Larger values use more memory but process faster.
  batch_size: 10000

  # distance (str): The distance metric used for similarity computations. Common options
  # include "cosine". Other options can be found here:
  # https://github.com/cytomining/copairs/blob/main/src/copairs/compute.py
  distance: cosine

trt_copairs_map_configs:
  # Parameters for calculating the mean average precision (mAP)

  # same_by (list[str]): Specifies the metadata columns to focus on when computing
  # the mAP score. For instance, to calculate the mAP score for a single treatment,
  # this parameter ensures the mean of AP scores is computed across entries with the
  # same treatment.
  same_by: ["Metadata_treatment"]

  # null_size (int): Defines the size of the null distribution when calculating p-values.
  null_size: 1000

  # threshold (float): Specifies the p-value threshold for determining statistical significance.
  threshold: 0.05

dmso_copairs_ap_configs:
  # Configuration for calculating Average Precision (AP) specifically for control wells (DMSO).
  # These settings define how pairs of profiles are compared based on metadata and distance metrics.

  # pos_sameby (list[str]): Specifies metadata columns that group profiles into positive pairs.
  # Positive pairs are formed by comparing profiles within the same group. For DMSO, this ensures
  # that control wells on the target plate are compared with each other, and reference wells
  # are compared with each other.
  pos_sameby: ["Metadata_targeted"]

  # neg_sameby (list[str]): Defines metadata columns used to identify negative pairs with shared attributes.
  # Negative pairs are restricted to have the same treatment (e.g., DMSO) to ensure a consistent comparison
  # within treatment groups.
  neg_sameby: ["Metadata_treatment"]

  # neg_diffby (list[str]): Specifies metadata columns that introduce variation in negative pairs.
  # Despite sharing the same treatment, these columns differentiate pairs by comparing wells from the
  # target plate to wells from the reference plate. This ensures comparisons between DMSO control wells
  # from distinct plates.
  neg_diffby: ["Metadata_targeted"]

  # batch_size (int): Defines the number of profiles to process in a single batch during similarity computation.
  # Larger batch sizes improve processing speed but require more memory. Adjust based on available resources.
  batch_size: 10000

  # distance (str): The distance metric used to compute similarity between profiles.
  # "cosine" is the default metric, but other metrics can be configured. For more options, refer to:
  # https://github.com/cytomining/copairs/blob/main/src/copairs/compute.py
  distance: "cosine"

dmso_copairs_map_configs:
  # Parameters for calculating the mean average precision (mAP)

  # same_by (list[str]): Specifies the metadata columns to focus on when computing
  # the mAP score. This ensures that the mAP score is calculated for each plate
  # and control type. Essentially, a single mAP score is computed per plate for both
  # positive and negative references.
